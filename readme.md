# HackClub Bookmarklet

This project is a JavaScript bookmarklet that enables users to interact with a chatbot powered by Cohere's API. The chatbot provides helpful responses based on user prompts.

## How It Works

1. **Bookmarklet Execution**: The script runs as a bookmarklet in your browser.
2. **User Input**: When activated, it prompts the user to enter a message or question.
3. **API Interaction**: The input is sent to Cohere's chat API, which processes the request and generates a response.
4. **Response Display**: The chatbot's response is shown to the user via an alert.

## Problem It Solves

**Streamlined AI Interaction**: Effortlessly chat with AI without leaving the current webpage.

## How to Use

1. Copy the JavaScript code into a bookmark in your browser.
2. Click the bookmark to activate the chatbot.
3. Enter your prompt when prompted.
4. View the chatbot's response in an alert.
